# PDFToKeynote-iOS
Small utility to import PDF files into Keynote for iOS. This utility is especially helpful when presenting slideshows created by LaTeX. [A screen recording demoing the app is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aLM4_vE-rk).

Credits:
- This project is heavily based upon [Melissa O'Neill](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/)'s [PDF to Keynote for macOS](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html). She has spent countless hours fighting dragons in order to make sense of the unreadable Keynote XML format. This has, in turn, helped me tremendously when creating an iOS version of the PDF to Keynote converter in Swift.
